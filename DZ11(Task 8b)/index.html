    <p>On March 20, 2013, ID&T Belgium and SFX Entertainment announced that it would begin
        organizing an American spin-off of Tomorrowland, known as TomorrowWorld.[70] The
        festival is held at the Bouckaert Farm in Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, located 48
        kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Atlanta. The site was specifically chosen due to its
        resemblance to the Boom location in which Tomorrowland is traditionally held.
        The inaugural edition of TomorrowWorld, held 27, 28, and 29 September 2013, reused the
        "Book of Wisdom" design used for the main stage at Tomorrowland in 2012. The festival
        played host to over 140,000 attendees over the weekend. TomorrowWorld brought more than
        music, dancing and stunning visuals to the area that year - it brought an economic
        boost. Officials reported TomorrowWorld 2013 brought $85.1 million into the Georgia
        economy, including $70 million directly to Atlanta. That $70 million matches the impact
        the city got from hosting the NCAA Final Four in 2013.
        Nearly 140,000 attended the event, and their direct expenditures added $28.7 million
        into the local economy in areas such as lodging, restaurants and sight-seeing,
        TomorrowWorld officials said.
        The 2014 edition of TomorrowWorld was held on 26, 27, and 28 September 2014. The theme
        was "The Arising of Life," and used the volcano main stage which debuted at Tomorrowland
        in 2013. The festival hosted a pre-festival concert called "The Gathering" on Thursday
        25 September 2014 for attendees staying in Dreamville, the camp grounds of
        TomorrowWorld. Over 40,000 people camped at Dreamville, selling out the basic camping
        option. More than 160,000 people attended TomorrowWorld 2014.
        The third and final edition of TomorrowWorld was held on the weekend of September 25,
        26, and 27 2015. The event descended into chaos after being marred by inclement
        weather.Rain showers resulted in muddy terrain at the festival grounds, and entrance
        roadways to the grounds becoming unusable. On Saturday, due to the road conditions,
        organizers restricted shuttle service for attendees traveling back to Atlanta; those who
        were not stranded without shelter at the grounds overnight were required to hike miles
        towards areas where taxi cab and Uber drivers offered rides back to Atlanta at high
        prices. The following morning, festival organizers announced that the remainder of the
        festival would only be open to those who had camped on-site, and that refunds would be
        issued to those who were affected by the transport issues or had bought tickets for day
        3.
        On March 2, 2016, the official TomorrowWorld Facebook page announced that the festival
        will not be held in 2016.

    <p>In March 2018, Tomorrowland announced the coming of a new festival, Tomorrowland Winter,
        to take place annually during the second or third week in March in Alpe d'Huez in the
        French Alps.
        The first Tomorrowland Winter took place between 13 and 15 March 2019 and used the theme
        "The Hymn of the Frozen Lotus". It featured Martin Garrix, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike,
        Armin van Buuren, Martin Solveig, Afrojack, DJ Snake, Steve Aoki and others.For the
        participants, the choice of 4 or 7 day passes were available for packages including
        accommodation and skiing.
        On 13 August 2019, Tomorrowland announced that Tomorrowland Winter would return to the
        Alpe d'Huez for the 2020 edition which will be on the 3rd week of March with ticket
        sales opening in September.On 5 March 2020, the French Government decided to cancel the
        2020 edition due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 6 October 2020, it was announced that the
        2021 edition would also be cancelled due to the pandemic</p>
